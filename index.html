                This will just be a small crappy static website for some kind of use. 
                currently using no framework or any industry standards.

Currently a uni student going into the third year of study. 
This website will thus be a collection of things I will do and have done as a portfolio.</pre>

            <p>
                I do a technical study of artificial intelligence, but I like to mix creative and technical things.
                The other things I do are art, music and 3d printing.

                So just check something out on this website and fuck off.
