	<h1 class="page_header">Welcome to a webpage!</h1>

	<p>
		This will just be a small crappy static website for some kind of use. currently using Svelte.
	</p>

	<pre>
Currently a uni student going into the third year of study. 
This website will thus be a collection of things I will do and have done as a portfolio.</pre>

	<p>
		I do a technical study of artificial intelligence, but I like to mix creative and technical
		things. The other things I do are art, music and 3d printing.

	<p>So just check something out on this website and fuck off.</p>
